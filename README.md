**Built with React Native**
and the Yelp API

You must have Xcode (Mac OS) or Android Studio installed to follow the below instructions.

LocalFood uses the Metro Bundler https://facebook.github.io/metro/<br><br>
To run the app:
1. Download code to your local machine
2. You will need to install Metro via terminal, run: npm install --global expo-cli
3. In Terminal, cd into the root folder 'food', then run 'npm start'
4. The Metro Bundler will load in your browser at http://localhost:19003/
5. In the left rail of the Metro Bundler in your browser window, click option to run the iOS Simulator (or Android)
6. When app loads, click into the search box and search any food-related term to find Brooklyn restaurants!

Please note you will not be able to use the 'Run in web browser' option with Metro, as the API will cause a CORS error.
